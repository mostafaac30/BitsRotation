## Example for a number is represented in 16 bit

n = 11100101 \
Left rotation of n by 3 makes n = 00101111 (Left shifted by 3 and first 3 bits are put back in last). \
n = 11100101 \
Right rotation of n by 3 makes n = 10111100 (Right shifted by 3 and first 3 bits are put back in last). 

## Example for input and output: if number is represented in 32 bit

**Input:**
Number: 16\
Rotation type : Left or Right \
Number of bits for rotation : 2 

**Output:**
Left rotation : 64 \
Right rotation: 4
